# BST- Binary Search Tree

In computer science, a binary search tree (BST), also called an ordered or sorted binary tree,
is a rooted binary tree whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the
node's left subtree and less than those in its right subtree

## Complexity of operation in BST
* Search - Average: O(log n), Worst: O(n)
* Insert - Average: O(log n), Worst: O(n)
* Delete - Average: O(log n), Worst: O(n)
